//Array : fixed size when declared => Use dynamically allocate memory (stdlib.h)

//malloc(nbytes)

//Always check whether memory was successfully allocated
//ex : you want 4 memory blocks , but there are just 3 blocks, it will not successful

//Type casting : 
//int p = (int )malloc(n*sizeof(int)); // because malloc return void * ;
//(p points to a dynamic array)
